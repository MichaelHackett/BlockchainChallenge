To run Spek specifications in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, install the Spek Framework plugin
(Preferences > Plugins > search for "Spek Framework").

https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10915-spek-framework

There is a run configuration included to execute all of the app module specs (the only module that
has specs at the time of writing). (Running individual specs from the icons in the editor margin
was not working.)
